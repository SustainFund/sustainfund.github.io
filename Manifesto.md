If you actually care, then ***EMBODY genuine compassion.***  ASK questions about what this means, FOR YOU.

The GOOD causes out there do not primarily need your money or your funding ... they need YOU. {*Sure, helping out with expenses might be involved after YOU are involved ... but the GOOD causes are never primarily about the money*. }

Become **engaged** as a disciplined, intelligent compassionate human ... *becoming* ***engaged*** means DAILY discipline and improvement in daily discipline.

YOU get to pick the WHY driving your compassion ... WHY do you care about this cause? *WHY is it important enough to YOU that you should do something about it and basically ignore the other 37 bajillion good causes on the planet? For example, how is the collection plate at church needed to pay for the recurring Honeywell service contract on an HVAC system really any different from the needs of a crack addict who needs to experience the most exquisisite high known to humankind?* ***Has anyone DOGE'd the expense of your favorite church or charitable org lately?***

*Becoming* ***engaged*** means DAILY discipline and improvement in all daily disciplines ... including financial discipline. This is not about your money, **IT'S ABOUT YOU!**.

You are supposed to decide things for you ... but YOU have to pay attention. 

Paying attention means that YOU also get to determine what your your DAILY discipline of compassionate caring looks like and how you are going to improve upon that discipline ... you do not get to judge anyone else's why or anyone else's level of compassion ... you do not get to pass the collection plate for your causes -- if you are engaged in DAILY compassionate discipline, trust that people will be attracted to being part of the activity.


***Be a better example. EMBODY the continously improving the DAILY discipline of genuine compassion.*** 

# Practice Zero Overhead Philanthropy

If you are in the church or charitable org non-profit noble cause game, the first thing that you must do is ditch the idea your outfit has some sort of a monopoly on virtue -- GET SMARTER.

When some problem really matters to the point where it becomes someone's personal WHY ... then it's about ***GIVE OF YOUR SELF ON DAILY BASIS -- GIVING YOUR TIME and EXPERTISE*** Until then, *stop kidding yourself that showing up in church once a week OR writing checks OR practicing idiot virtue signalling compassion will fix anything.* 


## SUSTAIN Improvement Through Self-Sustaining Venture Philanthropy 

Funding is seldom the answer to any problem ... sure, activities come with expenses, but it is not about the money. 

Refuse to enable fundraisers that are perpetually fundraising in fund perpetual fundraising. Don't give in to guilt or ego; keep your powder dry. Conserve your capital for the cases in which you can ensure that capital matters -- until then, invest wisely. Don't worry, the needs will expand to consume any amount of capital.
