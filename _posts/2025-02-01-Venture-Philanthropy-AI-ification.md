## AI-ifying Venture Philanthropy

How has AI completely revolutionized *self-sustaining* venture philanthropy?

A *self-sustaining* venture is kind of philanthropic efforts that do not require ANY on-going donor support or fundraising drives ... **SUSTAIN** Fund is entirely about this form of start-up initiation, ie there's absolutely no reason for us to start anything that is fundamentally ***unsustainable** and is going to require passing the collection plate or holding benefit events for on-going financial support OR anything like taxpayer-funded grants or grants from charitable entities. 

**SUSTAIN** Fund is entirely about ***sustainable*** start-up initiation.

Self-sustaining venture philanthropies overcome the traditional problems with philanthropies, churches, charitable organizantion because they function primarily as *clubs* in with volunteers or *club-members* particpate because of the shared *club good* that participation produceds. Volunteers love the nature of the shared activity and association with other club members who are similarly into sharing, working together, helping to sustain the cause. These entities are not for-profit ventures, but they do sell services and products. The point is to generate enough revenue through products and services to pay for things like property taxes on land or utility bills or minimal permanent, usually part-time staff for dealing with overhead and miscellaneous admin. mgmt issues.

It's pretty easy for an AI to suggest 100 questions to help one explore how AI is revolutionizing self-sustaining venture philanthropy. The following questions are an example of AI helps with AI ... how AI tools, open source development, and social coding are creating new possibilities for philanthropic ventures that can operate without continuous fundraising.

The following 100 topical areas represent the most important themes and perspectives ... each area has an example question to illustrate/explain what the topic is about.
