If you actually care, then ***EMBODY genuine compassion.*** 

Become engaged as a disciplined, intelligent compassionate human ... becoming engaged means DAILY discipline.

YOU get to pick the WHY driving your compassion ... WHY do you care? WHY is important to YOU. 

You also get to determine what your your DAILY discipline of compassionate caring looks like and how you are going to improve upon that discipline ... you do not get to judge anyone else's why or anyone else's level of compassion ... you do not get to pass the collection plate for your causes -- if you are engaged in DAILY compassionate discipline, trust that people will be attracted to being part of the activity.
