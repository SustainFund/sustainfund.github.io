If you actually care, then ***EMBODY genuine compassion.***  ASK [questions](https://sustainfund.github.io/Questions/) about what this means, FOR YOU.

The **genuinely** GOOD causes out there do not primarily need your money or your funding ... they need YOU. {*Sure, helping out with expenses might be involved after YOU are involved and knowledgable enough to know WHY the coins might matter ... but the GOOD causes are never primarily about the money*. }

Become **engaged** as a disciplined, intelligent compassionate human ... *becoming* ***engaged*** means DAILY discipline and improvement in daily discipline.

YOU get to pick the WHY driving your compassion ... WHY do you care about this cause?
